     Welcome to the Counter-Strike Football League


Terrorists: Offense

CounterTerrorists: Defense


Its the last play of the game and 4th and goal for the terrorists.
Try to plant the bomb in the CT endzone.You have 3 sec to huddle and
then 10 sec to get in formation and devise a play. When the whistle
goes off get to the line of scrimmage. When you hear the QB yell
"HutHut" its on!

All you get is a knife and T's get a knife and bomb.

This map my play better if the C4 timer is set below 6 sec so cant
be diffused.
