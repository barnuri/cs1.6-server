by DaveJ (dv@btinternet.com)

Counter-Terrorists: Prevent Terrorists
from bombing the abandoned warehouse.
Team members must defuse any bombs 
that threaten the targetted area.

Terrorists: The Terrorist carrying the
C4 must destroy the warehouse by placing
the C4 charge where marked.

Other Notes: There is only one place in 
which the bomb may be placed. Both teams 
are pre-equipped with items.
