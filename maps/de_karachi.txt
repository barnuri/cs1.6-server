Welcome to the deadly streets of Karachi, Pakistan. 

Intelligence reports have been mounting recently saying that
a terrorist strike is imminent. There appears to be an 
arms cache in the west of the city. This looks to be their main target.
We cannot allow them to gain control of these arms. 
The terrorist faction's MO in the past has been
to create a diversion elsewhere in the city, often hitting public targets. 

CTs must focus on the arms cache, but are obliged to protect the locals
if possible. We have a CT unit on standby a few blocks from the arms cache. 
Once the word is given they will proceed with Operation-Dustkiller.

Terrorists: plant the bomb by the porch or at the bus.

Counter Terrorists: defuse the bomb and/or neutralize the terrorists 
- with extreme prejudice.
