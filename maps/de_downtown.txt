A picturesque Dutch town has become the focus of a five-year money laundering 
and tax evasion investigation linked to a series of murders, drug trafficking, 
p0rn0graphy, and millions of Euros in allegedly dirty cash.

Sources say that the Terrorist group Al-Geyduh is using the money to wire large
“loans” through a Holland bank account. 
The Dutch government assigned a group of undercover agency to infiltrate the terrorist 
organization in order setup an ambush and to retrieve the loot in the train-units. 
Unfortunately, Al-Geyduh has learned of the Counter-Terrorism operations 
and surprised the Counter-Terrorism movement with heavy resistance. 

TERRORIST: Your mission is to infiltrate the Dutch town. 
Locate the railway, and retrieve the smuggled money and loot. 
Use all means necessary to recover the goods. 
Beware, the town has been under close watch by Counter-Terrorism forces, 
creating a diversion maybe necessary to recover the cash. 
Plan B would involve bombing a nearby café, distracting the opposition and their resources.

COUNTER-TERRORIST: Your mission, protect the town from Al-Geyduh. 
Beware, they are desperate and may try anything. You are equipped to fight them, 
so shoot to kill, and ask questions later.
