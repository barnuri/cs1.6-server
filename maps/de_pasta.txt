Storyline:

The FBI has been informed of a possible strike
against the mafia family leader in New Jersey 
by an anonymous call to a local police station. 
Once the police had reason to believe the threat
was real they evacuated Bernardigio Nuccio's family
from his residence which was located above his
Italian restaurant. The police know that the 
restaurant itself has served as a meeting place 
for Nuccio's organisation, consequently making
it the perfect location for a revenge performed 
by another mafia family.

Counter-Terrorists:

Your mission is to stop this unnecesary strike
of terror at all cost. You have been informed
of a possible bomb threat which is to be prevented 
by any means neccesary. Secure the the entire 
building. Do not let this operation turn into a
big bowl of bloody pasta!

Terrorists: 

Your primary objective will be to eliminate 
Bernardigio Nuccio and his family. The secondary
goal is to "clean" out all evidence of your 
presence by planting a bomb in one of the two 
strategical bomb spots. These two locations will
be the most efficient way to cause destruction
to this filthy mafia family that betrayed us.
