Background: A small terrorist organisation has
planned to destroy hotel Morningstar. The
terrorist organisation got founded as a reaction
against the groving giant company which owns 
the hotel: International Hotel Cooperation
(IHC) and it's extremly rich directors. Hotel
Morningstar is IHC's premier hotel and a 
landmark for the entire cooperation.

Terrorists: Plant a C4 bomb in the large
entertaining room, or the garage in order
to colapse the whole hotel.

Counter-terrorists: Stop the terrorists from
planting the bomb at all costs.

Other notes: There are two bomb targets
in this map.
