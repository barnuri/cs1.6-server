Background:
A Terrorist organization from around the globe has

to lead the way to the Holy Grail. 
The map resides in a small Antique shop in Parma, 
Italy and is the Terrorist faction's next target.   

Terrorists:
Make your way to the Antique Shop in the lower end 
of Town, to steal the map and destroy the building.

Counter-Terrorists: 
The Terrorists are heading towards an Antique shop 
found in the lower end of town. You must stop the 
Terrorists from planting their bomb at all costs!
