Some Curiosa.

The two Pitchures in the T,s room are pitchures of the makers of the map

Well actually The pitchure in the "hostage room" is me =)

And dont try to rescue the hostages you cant they are ment to be "observers of the match"

You can blow up an huge nuke near t,s house extreamly irretating but adds fairness to the match
when the t can camp on their house with outplaced awp,s
