DESCRIPTION
Star Wars Map! Run along the surface of the deathstar and plant the bomb in the trench. Buahahahahaha.

NOTES
I know it isn't "logical" for the terrorists to be the rebels and the counter-terrorists to be the empire, i know it should be vice-verca, but i had to do it this way or it couldn't be a de_ map. Because counter-terrorists don't plant bombs, now do they?
