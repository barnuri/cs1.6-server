Terrorists:
- Bomb the hangar or
the heroin production hall.

Counter-Terrorists:
- Prevent the Terrorists from bombing.

Storyline:
Counter-Terrorist forces are covertly 
assisting the infamous drug lord 
Assante in smuggling large volumes of 
heroin into the United States. As this 
threatens to debase the Phoenix 
Connection's stakes in the lucrative 
drug industry, the Terrorists are 
mounting an attack on Assante's 
largest shipment and cache of heroin, 
staged in an WW2 old American military
compound on remote Buru Island in
Indonesia.
