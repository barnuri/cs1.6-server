DESCRIPTION
Star Wars Map! Fly your x-wings and 
tie fighters through the death star trench 
and blow it up. Buahahahahaha.

NOTES
I know it isn't "logical" for the terrorists to 
be the rebels and the counter-terrorists to be 
the empire, i know it should be vice-verca, 
but i had to do it this way or it couldn't be 
a de_ map. Because counter-terrorists don't 
plant bombs, now do they?
