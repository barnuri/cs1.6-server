Story:
A year ago, the battle in 828_dust.
Counter-Terrorists defeated 828Kill-U
Organization and stopped them from 
bombing a main road in town.

But while they were defusing the bomb.
Leader of the group 828-Killer escaped 
successfully.

He left a spray on words with message:
"Even i fail this time, but no one
lose forever.I will be back, then..."
with a blood handprint under the spray.

A year passed. CTs again got info about
the 828Kill-U. They are striking back, 
and the place to be is 828_dust2 4 KM away.
They are planning to blow the water supply
and spread virus.

Once the virus is spread. All place near
river will be infected. At this time, the
blood handprint and the spray came into CT's Mind again.
