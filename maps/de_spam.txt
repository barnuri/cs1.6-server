Red alert in cyber space! The global internet mafia is sending
massive spam mail to force innocent user to buy there brain drugs.

But the heroes are near. They try to spoil that dirty business
by blowing up the drug depots. 

Unfortunately corrupt pigs are willing to protect the depots.

Counter-Terrorists:
Don't believe that story! It's all lies. Protect the depots.

Terrorists:
Save the world and plant the bomb in one of the two depots.
