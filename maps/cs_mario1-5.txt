About the map :
	This is a Mario bros. themed map. SHotties Only Map. Have some fun...and see if you recognize any similarities =). A player going by the name Super Shotty Mario Bros. Mario created the layout for the level and Quiv or UberFubarLlama put it all together.

Mario IS a Close Friend of Mine and played on 7iT's site and had a site called SuperShottyBros but Lack of funds killed it. So here it is and it is fun.

Rigges AKA SGT Martin Rigges LAPD lets play it have fun......

.... And here's a word from Mario himself:

	"Mario wants to thank Uber Fubar Llama for the time and the work on this map. Uber shocked me by getting the main map made up while we were talking about my design. Big Thanks to the Llama! "
