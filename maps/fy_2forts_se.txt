Fixes:
------

Map is symmetrical.

Fixed ladder brushes.

Sky top is raised higher.

CTs start facing the fort, not the back wall.

Player spawns closer in, away from the sides, to prevent spawn killings.

Added more weapons on the ground. 

Textures are aligned.

Buyzone is in the cage in the middle of the map 
to eliminate grenade spamming, and makes it harder
to buy AWP.

Players are equiped with armor and helmet and a p228 pistol
at the start of each round.
