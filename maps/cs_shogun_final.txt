The Japanese Palace built by the infamous 
Shogun Yasuda, has been re-opened
for the first time in over 500 years. 
A highly skilled and dangerous team of Japanese
and European Militants have infiltrated the high
temple building in an attempt to retrieve ancient 
scripts the ancient shogun's sorcerers had worked
on which were said to contain instructions showing
a way to open a doorway into hell itself.   

The Terrorists had not banked upon a team of 5 scientists
and archaeologists being at the site. One of the 
team had escaped, and have alerted the Japanese Law 
enforcement. As a result the reamining team have been
held hostageand now serve as currency for the Militants
safe escape.
